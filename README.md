# Project Info

This project is part of the react course created by Dave Gray(https://youtu.be/RVFAyFWO4go). I didn't follow it to a tee the differences is i'm using react-router-dom, axios and styled-components.

- If you want to try this project clone it then go inside the terminal run npm i or the yarn equivalent. Then after that is done run npm start and your good.

- I'm just messing with the fake api date from this website here https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
